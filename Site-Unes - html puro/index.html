                    Lorem <strong>Ipsum is simply</strong> dummy text of the printing and <em> typesetting industry</em>. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                     industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                     and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
                     the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
                     1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                     desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
